Grip the bar slightly wider than shoulder-width, with wrists straight. Lower the bar with control to your chest, touching lightly at nipple level.

Take a deep breath, brace your core, and drive through your heels to lift the bar. Keep it close to your body as you stand up, finishing with hips and knees fully extended.

Good options include oatmeal with banana and almond butter, whole grain toast with eggs, or a chicken and rice bowl. If eating closer to your workout (30-60 minutes), choose easily digestible options like a banana with peanut butter, Greek yogurt with berries, or a small protein shake. Stay hydrated by drinking 16-20 ounces of water 2 hours before exercise.";

Key exercises to include are squats, push-ups, rows, and planks. Gradually increase weight or difficulty as you become comfortable with the movements. Remember, consistency is more important than intensity at this stage. Track your progress and celebrate small wins along the way.";

I can help with exercise form, workout programming, nutrition advice, or recovery strategies.";
