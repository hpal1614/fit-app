2. Add database persistence (IndexedDB)
3. Enhance AI with better prompts
4. Build real workout generation
5. Add exercise form videos
6. Implement progress tracking

### How to Test
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Test on mobile
# 1. Open browser dev tools

# 3. Navigate between tabs
# 4. Test AI chat (should respond within 5 seconds)
# 5. Test voice button (should handle permission denial)
```

### Performance Metrics
