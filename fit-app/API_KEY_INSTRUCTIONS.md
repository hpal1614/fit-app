## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Status: API Keys Invalid

## üìã Required API Keys

You need at least ONE of these (all three recommended for best reliability):

2. Click "Sign Up" (you can use Google/GitHub)
3. Go to https://openrouter.ai/keys
4. Click "Create Key"
5. Add $5 credit (lasts for thousands of messages)
6. Copy your key starting with `sk-or-v1-`

### 2. Groq API Key
**Best for:** Super fast responses
**Cost:** FREE (with rate limits)

**Steps:**
1. Go to https://console.groq.com
2. Sign up for free account
3. Go to API Keys section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy your key starting with `gsk_`

### 3. Google AI (Gemini) API Key

1. Go to https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
2. Sign in with Google account

## üîß Setup Instructions

1. **Update your .env file:**
```bash
# In fit-app directory
nano .env
```

2. **Replace the invalid keys with your new ones:**
```env
# Core AI APIs
VITE_OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-new-openrouter-key-here
VITE_GROQ_API_KEY=your-new-groq-key-here
VITE_GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=your-new-google-ai-key-here
```

3. **Restart the development server:**
```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C) then:
npm run dev
```

## ‚úÖ Testing Your Setup

Run the test script to verify:
```bash
node test-ai-api.js
```

You should see:
- ‚úÖ OpenRouter API working!
- ‚úÖ Groq API working!
- ‚úÖ Google AI API working!

## üöÄ Quick Fix Priority

If you want to get started quickly:
1. **Groq** is the fastest to set up (completely free)
2. **Google AI** is also free but may have stricter rate limits
3. **OpenRouter** gives the best quality but requires payment

## üí° Troubleshooting

**"Invalid API Key" errors:**
- Make sure you copied the ENTIRE key
- Check for extra spaces or line breaks
- Ensure the key starts with the correct prefix

**"Unauthorized" errors:**
- OpenRouter: Add credit to your account
- Groq: Wait if you hit rate limits
- Google: Enable the Gemini API in your project

**Still not working?**
- Clear browser cache
- Check browser console for errors
- Make sure .env file is in the fit-app directory
- Restart the dev server after changing .env

## üéØ Next Steps

Once your API keys are working:
1. Test the AI chat in the app
2. Try different prompts
3. The system will automatically failover between providers
4. Monitor which provider gives best results for your needs
