## ⚠️ **Areas for Improvement (Non-Critical)**

### 🔧 **Code Quality Issues**
```
ESLint Warnings: 762 total
- 736 errors (mostly unused imports and 'any' types)
- 26 warnings (missing dependencies in useEffect)
```

**Impact:** App works perfectly, but code could be cleaner

### 📦 **Performance Optimization**
```
Bundle Size Analysis:
- Main chunk: 740KB (could be optimized)

```

**Impact:** App loads fine, but could be faster

### 🎯 **Type Safety**
- Some `any` types used instead of proper interfaces
- Missing dependency arrays in some useEffect hooks
- Unused imports in many components

**Impact:** Functional but not ideal for long-term maintenance
